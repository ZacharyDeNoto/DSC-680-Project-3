# US Traffic Impact from Car Accidents

**Intro** - Every year millions of people are involved in car crashes unfortunately. Car crashes impact both drivers, friends, family, and traffic. The average driver wastes between 2-4 days woth of unnecessary time in traffic. This analysis looks at the impact of traffic caused from a car accident. The dataset has almost 3 million rows of accidents from 2016-2020 retrieved from multiple traffic API's. It also looks to see what impact Covid-19 had on traffic from accidents.

**Tools** - Python, R, Pandas, Modeling

**Data** - Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Machine learning, Model fitting

**Conclusion** - Based on the results of this analysis it appears that you can indeed predict the severity of traffic based on factors of a car accident. It also appears that it is easier to predict traffic from accidents during Covid-19 as opposed to before Covid-19. The average time impact of traffic was greater during Covid-19 even though the average severity was lower. Accidents during Covid-19 must have been worse as there were less cars on the road during this time period.
